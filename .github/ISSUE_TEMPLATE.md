# Points to consider before writing your issue

* This repository works with the Manim version of February 3, unless otherwise indicated. If your code does not work, check that you are using the correct version.
* At the moment Manim works with Python 3.7, not with 3.8. This is because several of the dependencies have not yet been updated.
* If the terminal throws an error, please write it completely with the markdown format.
* Be clear and specific with your problem, share the code (and files, if applicable) and the command you use when rendering the video.
